PROJECT 1

NAME: Omar Hussain

DATE OF COMPLETION: February 20, 2019

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:

Hangman is a simple game where the player needs to guess a phrase. In your implementation, the program will randomly select a movie title and display a shadow of the movie name using asterisks. If the movie is "Star Wars", the program will show ---- ---- at the beginning of the game. The user then tries to guess the movie title by entering one letter at time. If the user tries 'A' or 'a', the next display shall be: --a- -a-- However, the user is only allowed 7 mistakes. Once the user guesses all the letters in the phrase, that person wins.
